    <h1>ANDREA MOORE</h1>
    <p>
      I have worked as a defense attorney representing families throughout West
      Kentucky for well over a decade. I also clerked for retired Supreme Court
      Justice Bill Cunningham when he was Circuit Judge and learned first hand
      the type of judge I would like to be. I became concerned after covid hit
      when I saw many workers in the justice system leaving their positions to
      seek new opportunities. If we lose the dedicated men and women that make
      up our local justice system we all lose out. I want to put the focus back
      on these employees and do any and everything I can to assist them in
      bringing forth justice to our community. I want to make their day to day
      work life better so the justice system can continue to function the way it
      should without high turnover due to these valuable people being overlooked
      and taken for granted.
    </p>

      I grew up in Calloway County, Kentucky. My granddad
      owned the local Singer sewing shop and my mother was employed by the US
      postal service in Murray, while my father worked as an engineer on the
      river. I have two daughters, Savannah who loves gymnastics, and Saylor who
      is into karate. My husband, Lance Moore, is a pharmacist at a local hospital
      and we live in his home county of Marshall in the small town of Possum Trot.
